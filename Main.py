Python is a high level general purpose programming language.
Python was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object oriented and functional programming.
NLP stands for Natural Language Processing.
NLP is a field of artificial intelligence that gives machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human language.
Common NLP tasks include tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part of speech tagging and named entity recognition.
A chatbot is a software application used to conduct an online chat conversation via text or text to speech.
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn from data.
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks.
TF-IDF stands for term frequency inverse document frequency and is used to measure how important a word is to a document in a collection.
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two documents are irrespective of their size.
